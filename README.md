Compare speed of different inference methods

- [kernl](https://github.com/ELS-RD/kernl) - [compare_kernl.ipynb](kernl_repo/compare/compare_kernl.ipynb)
- [transformer-deploy](https://github.com/ELS-RD/transformer-deploy) - [compare_transformer-deploy.ipynb](kernl_repo/compare/compare_transformer-deploy.ipynb)

Since each inference repo needs its own dependency and is rapidly evolving, we submodule them under different sub-directories with separate dev container configs.
